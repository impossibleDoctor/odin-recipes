                <i>A true French omelette, or omelet as we Americans call it,
                    is just eggs and butter, no filling. The egg is folded for a
                    soft, tender texture. It's 10% ingredients and 90%
                    technique, so it does take a bit of practice to perfect.</i>

        <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>3 large fresh eggs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon cold water</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne or white pepper to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="steps">Steps:</h2>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>
                Whisk eggs, water, and salt together in a mixing bowl. Whisk
                until mixture is very liquid and whites are completely
                blended in, 1 or 2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a 9- or 10-inch nonstick
                skillet over medium-high heat. As soon as butter melts and
                before it starts to sizzle, pour in whisked eggs. Stir in a
                circular pattern with a heat-proof spatula, lifting and
                scrambling eggs, shaking the pan to keep leveling out the
                mixture, and scraping down the sides. Continue stirring
                until shaking the pan no longer levels the eggs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Reduce heat to low. Using the spatula, smooth the surface to
                move runny eggs to less runny spots, working toward an even
                thickness. As soon as the surface is wet but not runny,
                remove from heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Starting at the handle side of the pan, use the spatula to
                begin rolling omelette into a cylinder shape, about 3 rolls
                until omelette is about 2 inches from opposite side of the
                pan. Use the spatula to fold the last flap of egg over the
                top of the cylinder leaving the seam-side up. Add remaining
                1/2 tablespoon butter to the pan. Gently push the butter as
                it melts under the omelette.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slide omelette to edge of the pan. Flip onto a plate with
                the seam-side down. Even out the shape, if necessary. You
                can tuck in the ends, if you like. Brush surface with a bit
                more butter. Dust with cayenne pepper.
            </li>
